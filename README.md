# ST Microelectronics - LSM303 - 3D accelerometer and 3D magnetometer

- namespace ***lsm***

## Boards

- Pololu LSM303D 3D Compass and Accelerometer (#2127)
    - The ***ST*** 'D' modules are obsolete but retail is still selling boards with the 'D' modules, yet the one from Pololu works great.
    - The ***ST*** **LSM303AGR** and **LSM303AH** are active.
        - Adafruit sales the **LSM303AGR**.

## IC Magnetic Sensors

A magnetometer, IC magnetic sensor, is a device that measures magnetic field. Different types of magnetometers measure the direction, strength, or relative change of a magnetic field at a particular location. A compass is one such device, one that measures the direction of an ambient magnetic field, in this case, the Earth's magnetic field....

## Testing Platform

This MCU chip **Atmega328P** is well known and the price is affordable as well as most of the robotic hardware that is described here. The Arduino Uno board comes with a removable MCU.

**PlatformIO** is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications for embedded products. 

**Visual Studio Code** is a streamlined code editor and it runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The best thing about VSCode, it is free.
